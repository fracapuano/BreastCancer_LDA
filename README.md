# BreastCancer LDA

For the Computational Linear Algebra for Large Scale Problems course, I and my teammate for this project, Alessandro Licciardi, applied LA based techiniques to tackle a classification problem. 

The approach used is significantly cheap in terms of data needs, as it reaches top performances on the chosen metric using a considerably small portion of the available data, in little quantity from the beginning. 

In this repository are presented both the code and a paper containing the full description of the problem and of the strategies we adopted to solve it. 
The dataset used is publicly available at UCI.
